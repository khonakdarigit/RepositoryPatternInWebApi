# ASP.NET Core Web API – Repository Pattern with Repository Wrapper

With the Repository pattern, we create an abstraction layer between the data access and the business logic layer of an application. By using it, we are promoting a more loosely coupled approach to access our data from the database. Also, the code is cleaner and easier to maintain and reuse. Data access logic is in a separate class, or sets of classes called a repository, with the responsibility of persisting the application’s business model.
